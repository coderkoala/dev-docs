## Code of conduct

Everest Forms has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Coding Guidelines

- **Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/php/)**
- Install our pre-commit hook using composer. It'll help with the Coding Standards. To install run `composer install` from the command line within the everest-forms plugin directory.
- Ensure you use LF line endings in your code editor. Use [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) if your editor supports it so that indentation, line endings and other settings are auto configured.
- When committing, reference your issue number (#1234) and include a note about the fix.
- Ensure that your code is compatible with PHP 5.4+.
- Push the changes to your fork and submit a pull request on the master branch of the Everest Forms repository. Existing maintenance branches will be maintained by Everest Forms developers.

Please **don't** modify the changelog or update the .pot files. These will be maintained by the Everest Forms team.
