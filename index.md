Anyone is welcome to fork this repository and send pull requests, but the project collaborators have write access directly to this repository. All PRs will be reviewed by at least one collaborator with write/push access and the PR must pass all the tests. Collaborators will be responsible for merging their own PRs once the reviews has been approved. Major feature development will require a review from the project lead, minor ones do not. For the best result, feature should be separated into their own plugins/addons, but project lead will evaluate this for each pull request depending on the requirements and scope.
